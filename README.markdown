gury - A jQuery inspired canvas utility library
================================================================================
by Ryan Sandor Richards

Gury (pronounced "jury") is a simple to use utility library for drawing and
animating when using HTML5 canvas tags. It takes the guess work out of setting
and allows you to build your scenes one object at a time.

It was built with simplicity in mind and its usage was modeled in the image
of jQuery. For instance you can initialize, style, and animate an entire scene
in a single expression using chaining.

Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Getting started with Gury is a piece of cake! Here's a step-by-step guide:

1) Create an HTML page and add a canvas with an id attribute to the body
2) Include `gury.js` in a script tag
3) Write some JavaScript to make a simple animation

To see it in action view the `demo.html` file in a canvas enabled browser.
